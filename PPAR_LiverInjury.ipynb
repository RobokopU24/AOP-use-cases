    "This notebook provides a deeper dive into the TRAPI options for querying the ROBOKOP KG using the ARA functionality. It assumes you are familiar with the concepts covered in `HelloRobokop.ipynb`.  This follows the same format and process as in `HelloRobokop_TRAPI.ipynb` except using the API based upon Automomous Relay Agent (ARA) methodology developed as part of the NIH Biomedical Data Translator to query the ROBOKOP knowledgegraph, which returns a score for each result.\n",

    "The edge IDs are then retrieved from the `results` and used to find the corresponding `predicate` label in the `knowledge_graph`. Two nodes can have more than one edge connecting them because each edge represents a distinct type of association derived from a single data source. Because of this, the number of rows in this report may differ from the set of results above. For an answer with three nodes such as this one, there will be at least one edge between nodes 1 and 2 as well as nodes 2 and 3. The direction of the edge connecting two nodes can differ as well, such as for \"Buprenorphine\" and \"CYP2D6\" below. Sometimes a single association type will be derived from multiple data sources. In the code below, we print a single edge for each association type and include the count of the number of data sources where that association was found. The following writes out all unique edges for each of the results in the format of `subject` -> `predicate` -> `object` and exports the information into a single file per `result`."

    "We see that the connection between Buprenorphine and CYP2D6 consists of two edge types `biolink:affects` and `biolink:directly_physically_interacts_with`. The `biolink:affects` relationship is bidirectional with one edge starting with Buprenorphine (`Buprenorphine -> biolink:affects -> CYP2D6`) and one starting with CYP2D6 (`CYP2D6 -> biolink:affects -> Buprenorphine`). These three edges are repeated for all results that include Buprenorphine and CYP2D6 as the first two nodes. Those results differ in the type of tremor found for the third node. There are three edges connecting Buprenorphine and OPRM1 (`biolink:affects`, `biolink:directly_physically_interacts_with`, `biolink:related_to`). Of note, the `biolink:affects` was identified in 4 different knowledge sources as indicated by the count reported after the colon."
